            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to DENI Cafe and Bakery. We are dedicated to providing a
              cozy space filled with freshly brewed coffee, delicious pastries,
              and friendly service. Our journey began in 2020, with a passion
              for bringing joy through sweet treats and aromatic coffee. Our
              vision was to create a place where friends and families could
              gather to enjoy comforting food and beverages in a welcoming
              atmosphere. At DENI, we are committed to quality. Every pastry is
              freshly baked with love and care, using only the finest
              ingredients. We carefully source our coffee beans to ensure the
              perfect brew for each cup. With every visit, we aim to create
              lasting memories with every bite and every sip.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              At DENI Cafe and Bakery, our mission is to craft high-quality
              baked goods and offer a warm, welcoming atmosphere. We aim to
              create a place where every visitor feels at home, enjoying not
              only great food but also memorable moments. Our team is passionate
              about what we do and strives to provide exceptional service to
              every guest. We believe that a great cafe should be more than just
              a place to get coffee. It should be a space where you can slow
              down, relax, and enjoy the simple pleasures in life. Our mission
              is to offer a sanctuary where people can escape from the hustle
              and bustle of everyday life, savoring every moment in the company
              of good food, great coffee, and even better company.
